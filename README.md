## Egghead.io - Getting Started with Redux by Dan Abramov

Just my working files from the amazing [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) course by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov), complete with Webpack setup and all. 

If you want to, for whatever reason, use the files, just `git clone` and then `yarn` and `yarn start` that bitch. In case you don't have the Webpack Dev Server not installed, add a `yarn global add webpack-dev-server` before that and you should be good to go.
